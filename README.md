# PARASITE: Polymorphic Adaptive Response And Sentinel for Infrastructure Threat Elimination

**PARASITE** is a complete, end-to-end security ecosystem designed to protect the firmware of embedded systems within Critical National Infrastructure (CNI). It features a hyper-efficient, 1.2KB on-device agent that provides real-time threat detection, hardware-enforced containment, and cryptographically secure reporting to a scalable cloud backend.

This repository contains the complete design documentation for the PARASITE project, developed for the KH4cks Hackathon. The documentation spans 16 phases, covering the entire project lifecycle from initial research and threat modeling to detailed hardware, firmware, and cloud architecture, culminating in a final presentation and packaging plan.

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **Hyper-Efficient Agent:** A sub-1.5KB firmware agent written in Rust, designed to run on resource-constrained microcontrollers with less than 0.1% CPU overhead.
-   **Zero-Day Threat Detection:** Employs a behavior-based **Sentinel** engine that uses entropy analysis to detect polymorphic and unknown malware, bypassing the need for traditional signatures.
-   **Hardware-Enforced Containment:** The **Guardian** engine uses the MCU's native Memory Protection Unit (MPU) to instantly quarantine threats in microseconds, preventing lateral movement or damage without crashing the device.
-   **Secure, Actionable Intelligence:** The **Reporter** module transmits anonymized, cryptographically signed threat reports to a cloud backend, transforming vulnerable endpoints into a distributed national threat intelligence network.
-   **Robust Security Foundation:** The system is built on a foundation of a secure bootloader (MCUBoot), a hardware-backed key hierarchy using a Secure Element, and a fail-safe, standards-aligned (IETF SUIT) OTA update mechanism.
-   **Comprehensive Design:** The project is documented across 16 phases, providing a professional-grade blueprint for a real-world deployment.
